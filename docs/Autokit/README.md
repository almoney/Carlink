Attempts at deobfuscation / decryption of the official Carlinkit Autokit App.
CPC200-CCPA rootfs had a 'BoxHelper' apk. Assuming they offloaded some of their code in the adapter itself.

Audio, Video, and USB Communication investigation.
Both the Autokit apk and BoxHelped pulled from flash storage were partially deobfuscated.
